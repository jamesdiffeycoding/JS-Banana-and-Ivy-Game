# Banana and Ivy Game

## Inspiration
Today computer games are often built with a wide variety of tools, yet there is still joy and learning to be found in simple projects. **Banana and Ivy is one such simple project**.

## What it does
This game is for desktop devices, to be played with a mouse. Get from A-B while collecting all the bananas (and avoiding the ivy) in as quick a time as possible.

## How we built it
This Pokedex was created entirely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (thank you event listeners!)

## Challenges we ran into
For me, this was the first time I had installed Ruby on Rails on my computer, so there was a lot of setup work.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a game that is functional, involves a timer feature, and displays your progress as you go without using React (which would have made it easier).

## What I learned
I learned about tying event listeners to many HTML elements that have the same class using the 'forEach' method, as well as considering user experience. I also learned it was possible to disable right-clicking (a common way of 'cheating' these sorts of games to bypass the ivy-collision).

## Built with
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (lots of event listeners!)

## What's next?
For the next game I make, I'd like to learn more about unit collision between two html elements (other than the cursor). For example, in a football game if a player runs into the ball.
