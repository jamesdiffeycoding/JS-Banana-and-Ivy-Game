# Reflections
- As I expected, I think React would have made this a bit quicker to make but nonetheless it was good practice and fun to revisit older methods :) 
- I made a mistake with some copy and pasting in my grid elements in the html, so its a bit messy. That's what I get for coding when I'm a bit sleepy!
